# Sticky-piston
Okay, I developed a sticky piston only for pleasure. But, if this project is noticed and supported, I will start learning HTML, CSS, node.js and electron.js to continue to develop a sticky piston as a messenger. And also, maybe I will create some kind of social network.
Ps - Photoshop: By the way, it is written here why I needed the above programming languages: https://pastebin.com/MqrVJsXz
